This directory contains data, e.g., test data, pretrained models, etc.

The contents of this directory are ignored by git by default, in order to
prevent accidentally committing binary data to version control. If you want to
add something (for example, data for unit tests), run 'git add -f ...' instead
of 'git add ...'.
